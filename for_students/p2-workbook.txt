[ ] correct P2 Canvas Assignment submission on time [none]: 
[X] completed p2-workbook.txt in the for_student folder correctly [none]: 
[X] clear explanations in p1-workbook.txt [none]: 
[X] program runs (or seems to run correctly - worth looking at error console) [final-grtown]: 
[X] frame rate seems OK (not too slow) [final-grtown]: 
[X] UI is there and seems to work (can lookat and ride) [final-grtown]: 
[X] highlight list looks OK [final-grtown]: 
[X] visually distinct from example [final-grtown]: 
[X] theme makes sense (need explanation) [final-grtown]: I tried to recreate a small part of downtown chicago, so it made sense to include skyskrapers, and the metro train, roads, and other stuff. The ferris wheel location represents a tourist attraction called navy pier.
[ ] cool theme bonus (need explanation) [final-grtown]: 
[X] objects created for this assignment 1, not trivial, can be identified in world (need explanation) [final-grtown]: I created the train track object for this assignment
[X] objects created for this assignment 2, not trivial, can be identified in world (need explanation) [final-grtown]: I created the skyskrapers for this assignment
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 1, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: I created the benches
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 2, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: I created the buoys, the bobbing spherical objects in the water
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 3, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: I created the trees
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 4, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: I created the ferris wheel
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 5, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: I created the boat
[X] has building, natural, vehicle (need explanation) [final-grtown]: the buildings are the skyskrapers, the natural objects are the trees, and the vehicles are the train, cars and boat
[X] loaded model (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The train is the loaded model
[X] shader: identifiable and not trivial (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The water has the shader. I made waves using sin and cosin
[X] three behaviors you made 1, not trivial, can be identified in scene (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The cars move back and forth, and stop in the middle before a stop sign
[X] three behaviors you made 2, not trivial, can be identified in scene (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The train follows a curve aorund the city
[X] three behaviors you made 3, not trivial, can be identified in scene (need explanation) [final-grtown]:  The ferris wheel rotates, moving the cabins along with it
[X] at least one object is rideable / followable [final-grtown]: cars, boat, and train is rideable/followable
[X] behavior that is not simple (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The boat follows a curve, moves it's paddles back and forth and stops at 2 locations
[X] articulated figure (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The ferris wheel is articulated, because the cabins move in relation to the wheel
